## Late Projects and Extensions

I used to extend project deadlines, but I have found that this is
often unfair to the students who start on time (and more students than
I would have thought have raised this point to me
privately). Therefore, project extensions will be rare--and usually
only done if it is becasue of a mistake I made. Project extensions for
students will not be granted except for religious observances and
extenuating circumstances (family illness, etc..). The late policy is
as follows:

- Projects turned in on time will earn a maximum of 100%

- Projects turned in up to 48 hours late will have a 15% penalty
  applied.

- Projects turned in after 48 hours late (until the end of the term)
  will have a 30% penalty applied.

- Your project grade always be the maximum possible. For example,
  let's say you make an on-time project submission for 60%, but you
  then turn in a project which earns an 75%. This submission would
  earn a 63.75%. Three days after the deadline you turn in a project
  earning 100%. Your final score is 70%, as the 70% (100% with a 30%
  penalty) still got the maximum grade of any submission.

In other words, you *should* be able to earn **at least** a 70% on all
of the projects with enough work.

## Projects and Labs

This course will have between six and eight individual projects and
(roughly) weekly labs. Each of these will be completed using the
course's autograder. Lab attendance is expected and required. You may
be excused from labs with adequate notice to and permission from the
instructor.
